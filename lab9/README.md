##### Strategy Pattern:  
In strategy design pattern we need to create different classes for different strategies. Here we need to create different 
implementations of interface. This makes process lenghthy and complex in comparison to lambda. 

##### Lamba Function:  
Lambda expression creates different implementations of strategy in a single class. We avoided the use of class declaration for different 
strategies implementation and instead made use of the lambda expressions.
